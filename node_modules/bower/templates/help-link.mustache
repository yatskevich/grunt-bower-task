Usage:

    {{#cyan}}bower{{/cyan}} link
    {{#cyan}}bower{{/cyan}} link {{#grey}}<pkg>{{/grey}}

Options:

    {{#yellow}}--no-color{{/yellow}} - Do not print colors

Description:

    The link functionality allows developers to easily test their packages.
    Linking is a two-step process.

    Using {{#grey}}bower link{{/grey}} in a project folder will create a global link.
    Then, in some other package, {{#grey}}bower link <pkg>{{/grey}} will create a link in the components folder
    pointing to the previously created link.

    This allows to easily test a package because changes will be reflected immediately.
    Please note that bower will not fetch the linked package dependencies.

    Bower will overwrite the link when installing/updating.
